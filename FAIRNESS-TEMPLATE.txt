GPLX Fairness Framework
XBasic-1.0

This file defines the contribution terms for this GPLX-licensed project.
See LICENSE for base terms and philosophy.

===
THRESHOLD

Contribution triggers when ALL of these are true:
1. Entity is a commercial organization (for-profit)
2. Entity uses the software in production/commercial capacity
3. Entity annual revenue exceeds $500,000 USD

Below threshold = completely free, no strings attached.

===
TWO PATHS

Choose your path based on your needs:

Open Path (GPL-style):
- Share modifications (open source)
- Lower contribution tier

Closed Path (MIT-style):
- Keep modifications private
- Higher contribution tier (3x Open Path)

===

license costs. Designed for ecosystem awareness, not extraction.
