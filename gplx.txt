GPLX - General Public License Extended
Version: 1.0
Framework Specification

===
OVERVIEW

GPLX = MIT + GPL + Fairness

GPLX introduces "Fairware" - a new approach to open source licensing.

"Sustainable fairness through open exchange and mutual good faith."

Fairware is:
- Not freeware (free but closed)
- Not shareware (try before buy)
- Not pure open source (no maintainer support)
- Not commercial (paid license upfront)

Fairware = open source + fair exchange when value is created

GPLX is an open source license framework that combines:
- MIT freedom (keep code closed if you pay for it)
- GPL openness (share-alike as default path)
- Fairness clause (sustainable maintainer support)

The X framework is a pluggable fairness module that allows maintainers
to define sustainable compensation terms. Users choose their path:
- Open Path: GPL-style, share modifications, lower cost
- Closed Path: MIT-style, keep code private, higher cost

Core philosophy:
- Open source should remain open
- Maintainers deserve sustainable income
- Corporations benefit, so should contributors
- Fairness goes both ways - no hostage situations
- Synergy over hostility, understanding over lawsuits

===
THE PROBLEM GPLX SOLVES

Traditional open source:
- Free to use, modify, distribute
- No obligation to support maintainers
- Maintainer burnout is epidemic
- Billion-dollar companies extract value, forgets about the maintainers
- Critical infrastructure depends on unpaid volunteers

GPLX solution:
- Keep all GPL freedoms
- Add fair contribution clause for commercial success
- Protect both developers AND corporations
- Create sustainable open source ecosystem

===
GPLX FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE

Dual Path System:
- Open Path: Based on GPL - share modifications, lower contribution
- Closed Path: Based on MIT - keep code private, 3x contribution

X Framework: Pluggable fairness module (defines thresholds, tiers, caps)

Available X Frameworks:
- XBasic - threshold + cap model (default)
- XTier - revenue tier model
- XUsage - per-user/per-seat model
- XCustom - negotiated terms
- (community can create more)

===
HOW IT WORKS

1. Software is released under GPLX + chosen X framework
2. Below threshold: use freely (both paths)
3. Above threshold: choose your path
   - Open Path: Share modifications, pay lower contribution
   - Closed Path: Keep code private, pay 3x contribution
4. Contributions go to maintainer(s)
5. Both parties benefit: company gets maintained software,
   maintainer gets sustainable income

===
X FRAMEWORK REQUIREMENTS

Any X framework must include:

1. THRESHOLD
   - Clear trigger for when contribution starts
   - Must exclude small users, startups, non-profits
   - Examples: revenue, employee count, user count

2. CONTRIBUTION TERMS
   - Clear amount or calculation method
   - Predictable (no surprise costs)
   - Reasonable (not extractive)

3. CAPS
   - Maximum contribution limit
   - Prevents "hostage situations"
   - Protects corporations from unlimited liability

4. GRACE PERIOD
   - Time before threshold applies
   - Allows startups to grow
   - Typically 1-2 years

5. NEGOTIATION CLAUSE
   - Option for custom terms if standard doesn't fit
   - Good faith requirement
   - Mutual benefit goal

6. EXEMPTIONS
   - Non-profits
   - Educational institutions
   - Personal/hobby use
   - Contributions back to project (code, docs, etc.)

===
ENFORCEMENT PHILOSOPHY

GPLX is NOT about:
- Lawsuits
- Hostage situations
- Extracting maximum money
- Punishing companies

GPLX IS about:
- Fair recognition of value
- Sustainable maintenance
- Mutual benefit
- Good faith relationships
- Open communication

Enforcement approach:
1. Friendly reminder first
2. Public registry of contributors (social proof)
3. Negotiation for edge cases
4. Legal action only as absolute last resort

===
X FRAMEWORK REGISTRY

Maintainers register their X framework choice:

Format: GPLX-{XFramework}

Examples:
- GPLX-XBasic
- GPLX-XTier
- GPLX-XUsage
- GPLX-XCustom
- GPLX-XHufron-Basic

Registry (future):
- Central database of X frameworks
- Version tracking
- Community submissions
- Compatibility checking

===
COMPATIBILITY

GPLX is designed to be:
- GPL-compatible at core
- Additive (adds terms, doesn't restrict)
- Clear (no legal ambiguity)
- International (works across jurisdictions)

Software under GPLX can be:
- Used by GPL software
- Forked (fork inherits GPLX terms)
- Combined with other GPLX software
- Included in larger projects (GPLX applies to GPLX parts)

===
FOR MAINTAINERS

To use GPLX:

1. Choose your X framework (XBasic recommended for most)
2. Add to your project:
   - LICENSE file with GPLX + X framework text
   - README mention: "Licensed under GPLX-XBasic"
3. Register project (optional, for discoverability)
4. Respond to contribution inquiries in good faith

===
FOR COMPANIES

To comply with GPLX:

1. Check X framework threshold
2. If below threshold: use freely
3. If above threshold:
   - Contact maintainer
   - Agree on contribution terms (usually standard X framework)
   - Set up payment (monthly/annual)
   - Get listed as contributor (good PR!)

Benefits:
- Maintained, quality software
- Direct line to maintainer for issues
- Good corporate citizenship
- Predictable, capped costs

===
VERSIONING

GPLX Framework: Semantic versioning (1.0, 1.1, 2.0)
X Frameworks: Independent versioning (XBasic-1.0, XBasic-1.1)

Projects specify:
- GPLX version
- X framework + version

Example: GPLX-1.0 with XBasic-1.0

===
GOVERNANCE

GPLX is maintained by the community.

Decisions made by:
- Rough consensus
- Public discussion
- Maintainer input
- Corporate input (they're stakeholders too)

Changes require:
- RFC process
- Comment period
- Version bump
