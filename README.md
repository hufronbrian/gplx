# GPLX - General Public License Extended

Open source with sustainable maintainer support.

## The Problem

Open source maintainers burn out. Critical infrastructure depends on unpaid volunteers. Billion-dollar companies extract value and forget about the maintainers.

## The Solution

GPLX = MIT + GPL + Fairness

- MIT freedom (keep code closed if you pay for it)
- GPL openness (share-alike as default)
- Fair contribution for commercial success
- Protect both developers AND corporations
- No hostage situations, no lawsuits - just fairness

## Fairware

GPLX introduces "Fairware" - a new approach to open source licensing.

"Sustainable fairness through open exchange and mutual good faith."

Fairware is:
- Not freeware (free but closed)
- Not shareware (try before buy)
- Not pure open source (no maintainer support)
- Not commercial (paid license upfront)

Fairware = open source + fair exchange when value is created

Key points:
- Code is open and free to use
- When you profit significantly, you contribute fairly
- Not forced, not aggressive - awareness-based
- Ecosystem health over extraction
- Mutual good faith between all parties

## Philosophy

GPLX is an awareness project - protecting open source ecosystem without disrupting commercial space or demonizing corporations.

- **For developers**: Sustainable income when your code creates real value
- **For companies**: Predictable, capped costs with maintained software
- **For everyone**: Fair ecosystem where open source can thrive

Corporations are not the enemy. Maintainer burnout is.

## How It Works

```
Small users, startups, non-profits → Free forever
Commercial success above threshold → Fair contribution (capped)
```

That's it. Simple.

## X Frameworks

GPLX is a framework. The "X" is your fairness module:

| Framework | Model | Best For |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **XBasic** | Revenue tiers + caps | Most projects |
| XTier | Fixed tiers | Simple pricing |
| XUsage | Per-user/seat | SaaS/tools |
| XCustom | Negotiated | Enterprise |

## XBasic (Default)

Two paths - choose based on your needs:

| Tier | Company Revenue | Open Path (GPL) | Closed Path (MIT) |
|------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| T1 | < $500k | Free | Free |
| T2 | $500k - $1M | $50/mo | $150/mo |
| T3 | $1M - $5M | $150/mo | $450/mo |
| T4 | $5M - $10M | $400/mo | $1,200/mo |
| T5 | $10M - $50M | $1,000/mo | $3,000/mo |
| T6 | $50M+ | $4,000/mo | $12,000/mo |

**Open Path**: Share modifications (GPL-style), lower cost
**Closed Path**: Keep code private (MIT-style), 3x cost

**Caps**: Max $4,000/mo (Open) or $12,000/mo (Closed) per project

**Exempt**: Non-profits, public education, government, startups (first 2 years), contributors

**Reference**: ~10-30% of typical commercial license costs

## Using GPLX

### For Maintainers

Add two files to your project:

1. **LICENSE** - Copy from `LICENSE-TEMPLATE.txt`
   - Base GPLX terms (Fairware philosophy, good faith, enforcement)
   - Fill in your contact info

2. **FAIRNESS.txt** - Copy from `FAIRNESS-TEMPLATE.txt`
   - Contribution tiers and caps
   - Exemptions and grace period

Why two files?
- LICENSE stays clean (philosophy, not price list)
- FAIRNESS.txt has the commercial terms
- Companies can easily find pricing
- You can swap X frameworks without touching LICENSE

### For Companies

1. Check LICENSE for philosophy and terms
2. Check FAIRNESS.txt for your tier
3. Below $500k revenue? Use freely
4. Above? Contact maintainer, set up contribution
5. Get maintained software + contributor recognition

## Files

- `gplx.txt` - Framework specification
- `xbasic.txt` - XBasic fairness framework (detailed)
- `LICENSE-TEMPLATE.txt` - Copy to your project as LICENSE
- `FAIRNESS-TEMPLATE.txt` - Copy to your project as FAIRNESS.txt

## FAQ

**Is this legally enforceable?**
Yes, as a license term. But our philosophy is communication first, legal action never (if possible).

**Can I fork and remove GPLX?**
No. License terms follow the code.

**What if I can't afford the contribution?**
Talk to the maintainer. Good faith negotiation is built into GPLX.

**Is this anti-corporate?**
No! Companies benefit too: maintained software, direct maintainer access, predictable costs, good PR.

## Why "GPLX"?

- **G**: GPL foundation - free software principles
- **PL**: Public License
- **X**: The extension - pluggable fairness framework

Why "X"? Because it's a variable. Plug in your fairness framework.

GPLX = MIT + GPL + Fairness, all in one license.

## Fork This

This project may not be actively maintained. That's okay.

GPLX is an idea, not a product. If you believe in sustainable open source:
- Fork it
- Improve it
- Create something greater
- Build the ecosystem we all deserve

The spec is public domain. Take it and run.
