XBasic - GPLX Fairness Framework
Version: 1.0
Default X Framework for GPLX

===
OVERVIEW

XBasic is the default fairness framework for GPLX.
Designed for simplicity, fairness, and sustainability.

GPLX introduces "Fairware" - a new approach to open source licensing.

"Sustainable fairness through open exchange and mutual good faith."

Fairware is:
- Not freeware (free but closed)
- Not shareware (try before buy)
- Not pure open source (no maintainer support)
- Not commercial (paid license upfront)

Fairware = open source + fair exchange when value is created

GPLX is essentially: MIT + GPL + Fairness
- MIT freedom (available via Closed Path)
- GPL openness (default, share-alike)
- Fairness (thresholds, caps, sustainability)

Key features:
- Two paths: Open (GPL-style) or Closed (MIT-style)
- Revenue-based threshold
- Tiered contribution
- Hard caps (no hostage situations)
- Startup grace period
- Exemptions for non-profits and education

===
THRESHOLD

Contribution triggers when ALL of these are true:

1. Entity is a commercial organization (for-profit)
2. Entity uses the software in production/commercial capacity
3. Entity annual revenue exceeds $500,000 USD

Below threshold = completely free, no strings attached.

Why $500k? Low enough to create ecosystem awareness early, high enough
to protect small businesses and solo entrepreneurs.

===
TWO PATHS: OPEN vs CLOSED

GPLX-XBasic offers two paths:

OPEN PATH (default):
- GPL-style: share-alike, open source modifications
- Lower contribution tier
- Must open source any distributed modifications

CLOSED PATH:
- MIT-style: keep modifications private/proprietary
- Higher contribution tier (3x Open Path)
- No share-alike requirement
- Can use in closed-source products

Choose your path based on your needs.
Both paths support maintainer sustainability.

===
CONTRIBUTION TIERS

Based on annual revenue (6 tiers):

| Tier | Revenue (USD)  | Open Path (GPL) | Closed Path (MIT) |
|------|----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| T1   | < $500k        | $0 (free)       | $0 (free)         |
| T2   | $500k - $1M    | $50/month       | $150/month        |
| T3   | $1M - $5M      | $150/month      | $450/month        |
| T4   | $5M - $10M     | $400/month      | $1,200/month      |
| T5   | $10M - $50M    | $1,000/month    | $3,000/month      |
| T6   | $50M+          | $4,000/month    | $12,000/month     |

Closed Path = 3x Open Path (pays for freedom to close)

All amounts per project using GPLX-XBasic.

Reference: These tiers are approximately 10-30% of typical commercial
license costs. Designed for ecosystem awareness, not extraction.

===
CAPS

Hard caps protect companies from unlimited liability:

Open Path:
- Per-project cap: $4,000/month
- Multi-project cap: $20,000/month to same maintainer
- Annual cap: $240,000/year to same maintainer

Closed Path:
- Per-project cap: $12,000/month
- Multi-project cap: $60,000/month to same maintainer
- Annual cap: $720,000/year to same maintainer

No exceptions. Caps are absolute.

===
GRACE PERIOD

New companies/startups:
- First 2 years: exempt from contribution
- Starts from company founding date
- Applies even if revenue exceeds threshold

Purpose: Let startups grow before contributing.

===
EXEMPTIONS

Fully exempt (always free):

1. Non-profit organizations (registered 501c3 or equivalent)

2. Educational institutions (public good):
   - Public schools (K-12, universities)
   - Non-profit private schools
   - Research institutions
   NOT exempt: for-profit education (bootcamps, online course platforms)

3. Government agencies (public good):
   - Federal, state, local government
   - Public services
   NOT exempt: for-profit government contractors

4. Personal/hobby use

5. Open source projects (that are themselves open source)

6. Companies that contribute back:
   - Code contributions (merged PRs)
   - Documentation
   - Bug reports with fixes
   - Significant community support

===
CONTRIBUTION IN KIND

Alternative to monetary contribution:

Companies may negotiate contribution-in-kind:
- Developer time (X hours/month on project)
- Infrastructure (hosting, CI/CD, etc.)
- Marketing/exposure
- Other valuable support

Value must be roughly equivalent to monetary tier.
Requires maintainer agreement.

===
CALCULATION

How to determine your tier:

1. Take company's annual revenue (last fiscal year)
2. Find matching tier
3. Multiply by number of GPLX-XBasic projects used
4. Apply multi-project cap if exceeded
5. Result = monthly contribution

Example:
- Company revenue: $15M
- Uses 3 GPLX-XBasic projects
- Tier: $150/month × 3 = $450/month
- Under cap, so: $450/month total

===
PAYMENT

Payment methods (maintainer's choice):
- GitHub Sponsors
- Open Collective
- Patreon
- Direct invoice
- Other (by agreement)

Payment frequency:
- Monthly (default)
- Quarterly (by agreement)
- Annual (by agreement, may include discount)

===
VERIFICATION

Revenue verification:
- Self-reported (honor system default)
- Maintainer may request verification for disputes
- Public companies: use public filings
- Private companies: signed attestation from officer

Disputes:
- Good faith discussion first
- Third-party mediation if needed
- Arbitration as last resort

===
INFLATION ADJUSTMENT

Tiers are reviewed every 3 years to maintain fairness.

Review process:
- Community discussion
- Adjust thresholds based on economic changes
- Round to nearest $25 for simplicity
- Announce 6 months before changes take effect

Goal: Keep thresholds meaningful over time without constant changes.

First review: 2029 (3 years from v1.0 release)

===
CHANGES TO STATUS

If company status changes:

Revenue increases:
- Move to new tier at next payment cycle
- No back-payment required

Revenue decreases:
- Move to lower tier at next payment cycle
- Provide notice to maintainer

Company acquired:
- New parent company's revenue applies
- Grace period does not reset

===
TERMINATION

Either party may terminate:

Company:
- Stop using the software
- Notify maintainer
- Complete current payment cycle

Maintainer:
- Cannot terminate contribution right
- Can transfer to successor maintainer
- Can release to pure GPL (removes X framework)

===
GOOD FAITH CLAUSE

GPLX is built on mutual good faith - not just from companies, but from
all participants in the ecosystem. Corporations are not inherently bad,
and maintainers are not inherently victims. We are partners in building
software that benefits humanity.

All parties agree to:
- Honest communication
- Reasonable interpretation of terms
- No gaming the system
- No hostage situations (from either side)
- Mutual respect and understanding
- Assume good intent first

For companies:
- Honor the spirit, not just the letter
- Recognize the value maintainers create
- Contribute fairly when you can

For maintainers:
- Be reasonable in enforcement
- Understand business constraints
- Communicate openly about project needs

For the public:
- Recognize that companies also contribute to the ecosystem
- Avoid blanket demonization of business
- Appreciate that sustainable open source needs all parties

If terms create genuine hardship:
- Discuss openly
- Negotiate alternative arrangement
- Document agreement
- Remember: we're building something together

FAQ

Q: I'm a solo developer making $50k/year, do I pay?
A: No. Threshold is $500k company revenue.

Q: I work at a big company but use it for personal projects?
A: Personal use is exempt. Company use triggers threshold check.

Q: What if my company uses it internally only, not in products?
A: Still counts as commercial use if you're above threshold.

Q: Can I fork and remove the X framework?
A: No. GPLX terms follow the code. Fork inherits GPLX.

Q: What if maintainer disappears?
A: After 1 year of no contact, contributions pause.
   If maintainer returns, contributions resume (no back-pay).

Q: Is this legally enforceable?
A: Yes, as a license term. But enforcement philosophy is
   communication first, legal action as absolute last resort.

Q: What's the difference between Open and Closed path?
A: Open Path = GPL-style, must share modifications (cheaper)
   Closed Path = MIT-style, keep code private (3x cost)

Q: Can I switch from Open to Closed path?
A: Yes. Pay the Closed Path rate going forward.
   No back-payment required for past Open Path usage.

Q: We're below threshold, can we still use Closed Path?
A: Yes. Below $1M = free for both paths. No restrictions.

Q: We use it Open Path now, but want to close one product?
A: Pay Closed Path rate only for the closed product.
   Open products stay on Open Path rate.

===
SUMMARY

XBasic in one sentence:
"A healthy software ecosystem through awareness, fairness, and mutual
good faith - where maintainers and companies thrive together."

XBasic philosophy:
